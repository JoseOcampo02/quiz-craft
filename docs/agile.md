# User Story
As a [role], I want [feature or action] so that [desired outcome].

### Acceptance Criteria
Criteria 1: [First specific requirement or outcome for completion]\
Criteria 2: [Second specific requirement or outcome for completion]\
Criteria 3: [Non-Functional requirements based on ISO/IEC 25010]\
Criteria 4: [Additional criteria as needed]\

### Metrics
Primary Metric: [Specific metric, e.g., "User engagement target increase of X%"]\
Secondary Metric: [Secondary metric, e.g., "Response time reduced to Y seconds"]

# Example of Agile:


### Epics
Large bodies of work that can be broken down into a number of smaller tasks (called stories).

Epic: Enhance Customer Support Response System
This epic aims to improve the responsiveness and efficiency of the customer support system, ultimately leading to increased customer satisfaction and retention.

---------------

### User Story
Describes a desired functionality or feature from the perspective of an end user. It provides a high-level understanding of what the user wants and why. It follows the standard format:
Role: Who is the end user or beneficiary?
Feature: What specific feature or action do they want?
Outcome: What is the benefit or purpose of this feature?

As a customer support agent, I want a real-time notification system for new customer queries so that I can respond to customer issues more quickly, improving customer satisfaction.

---------------

### Acceptance Criteria
Acceptance Criteria define the specific conditions that must be met for the story to be considered complete. They ensure clarity on what the product needs to accomplish to satisfy the user story. Acceptance criteria often use clear, testable statements.
Example Acceptance Criteria:
When a customer submits a new query, a notification is sent to the support agent within 1 second.\
Notifications display customer query details (name, issue type, priority level) without requiring additional clicks.\
Notifications are color-coded by priority level to help agents identify urgent queries quickly.\

Criteria 1: [First specific requirement or outcome for completion]\
Criteria 2: [Second specific requirement or outcome for completion]\
Criteria 3: [Non-Functional requirements based on ISO/IEC 25010]\
Criteria 4: [Additional criteria as needed]\

### Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs)
Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs) define quality attributes or system behaviors, often based on standards like ISO/IEC 25010, which includes aspects like performance, usability, security, and maintainability. These requirements ensure that the feature meets essential quality standards.\

Example NFRs (Based on ISO/IEC 25010):\
Performance Efficiency: Notifications must reach agents within 1 second, even under high load (10,000 simultaneous users).
Reliability: The system should maintain a 99.9% uptime for notifications over any 30-day period.\
Usability: Notifications should be visually accessible, using WCAG 2.1 guidelines to support agents with visual impairments.\
Security: Only authorized agents should receive notifications; data should be encrypted in transit to meet privacy standards.

---------------

### Metrics
Metrics are measurable indicators used to evaluate the success of the user storyâ€™s implementation. Metrics help the team assess whether the feature meets its intended goals and often relate to both the functionality and quality attributes.

Example Metrics:\
Response Time Improvement: Customer query response time reduces by 30% within the first month.\
Engagement Rate: Agent engagement with notifications (e.g., click-through or acknowledgment) increases by 20%.\
Customer Satisfaction: Customer satisfaction ratings for support improve by at least 15% after this feature release.\

---------------

### Research Spike
A Research Spike is an investigation or research task created to gather information needed to better understand or implement a story, often used to reduce uncertainty. For this story, the spike focuses on understanding current agent response times and the system's notification delivery efficiency.

Example Research Spike:\
Objective: Analyze current agent response times and the performance of existing notifications.\

Tasks:\
Review current average and peak response times for customer queries.\
Benchmark notification systems to determine best practices for instant delivery.\
Identify any latency issues that might affect notification speed, and recommend improvements.\

### Story Points

Story Points: 5

Story Points are written in Fibonacci sequence, we will use the following: 1,3,5,8\
Amount of effort required, 1 = minimum effort, 8 = maximum effort\
Amount of time required, 1 = less than a day, 8 = one week\
Task complexity, 1 = little complexity, 8 = high complexity\
Task risk or uncertainty, 1 = none, 8 = high\
